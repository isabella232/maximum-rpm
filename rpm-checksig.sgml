      <para>
        One aspect of RPM is that you can get a package from the Internet, and
        easily install it.  But what do you know about that package file?  Is
        the organization listed as being the "vendor" of the package
        <emphasis>really</emphasis> the organization that built it?  Did someone
        make unauthorized changes to it?  Can you trust that, if installed, it
        won't mail a copy of your password file to a system cracker?
      </para>
      <para>
        Features built into RPM allow you to make sure that the package file
        you've just gotten won't cause you problems once it's installed, whether
        the package was corrupted by line noise when you downloaded it, or
        something more sinister happened to it.
      </para>
      <para>
        The command <command>rpm -K</command> (The option
        <command>--checksig</command> is equivalent) verifies a package file.
        Using this command, it is easy to make sure the file has not been
        changed in any way.  <command>rpm -K</command> can also be used to make
        sure that the package was actually built by the organization listed as
        being the package's vendor.  That's all very impressive, but how does it
        do that?  Well, it just needs help from some "Pretty Good" software.

          The "Pretty Good" software we're referring to is known as "Pretty Good
          Privacy", or PGP.  While all the information on PGP could fill a book
          (or several), we've provided a quick introduction to help you get
          started.

        Once PGP is properly built and installed, the actual configuration for

              methods to direct PGP to the public keyring:

        After all the preliminaries with PGP, it's time to get down to business.
        First, we need to get the package builder's public key and add it to the
        public keyring file used by RPM.  You'll need to do this once for each
        package builder whose packages you'll want to check.  This is what
        you'll need to do:

      <para>
        Here we've added &RHI;'s public key, since we're going to check some
        package files produced by them.  The file
        <filename>RPM-PGP-KEY</filename> contains the key.  At the end, PGP asks
        us if we want to certify the new key.  We've answered "no" since it
        isn't necessary to certify keys to verify package files.
      </para>
      <para>
        Next, we'll verify a package file:

        <screen width="60">
<prompt># </prompt><command>rpm -K rpm-2.3-1.i386.rpm</command>

      </para>
      <para>
        While the output might seem somewhat anti-climactic, we can now be nearly
        100% certain this package:

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              was produced by &RHI;.

          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
        The output from this command shows that there are actually three
        distinct features of the package file that are checked by the
        <command>-K</command> option:

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              The <computeroutput>size</computeroutput> message indicates that
              the size of the packaged files has not changed.
            </para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>
              The <computeroutput>pgp</computeroutput> message indicates that
              the digital signature contained in the package file is a valid
              signature of the package file contents, and was produced by the
              organization that originally signed the package.
            </para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>
              The <computeroutput>md5</computeroutput> message indicates that a
              checksum contained in the package file and calculated when the
              package was built, matches a checksum calculated by RPM during
              verification.  Because the two checksums match, it is unlikely
              that the package has been modified.
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
        The <computeroutput>OK</computeroutput> means that each of these tests
        were successful.  If any had failed, the name would have been printed in
        parentheses.  A bit later in the chapter, we'll see what happens when
        there are verification problems.

        <para>
          With a bit of digging, we can see that each of the three tests was
          performed, and each passed.  The reason for that dire-sounding warning
          is that PGP is meant to operate without a central authority managing
          key distribution.  PGP certifies keys based on <firstterm>webs of
          trust</firstterm>.  For example, if an acquaintance of yours creates a
          public key, you can certify it by attaching your digital signature to
          it.  Then anyone that knows and trusts you can also trust your
          acquaintance's public key.
        </para>
        <para>
          In this case, the key came directly from a mass-produced &RHL; CDROM.
          If someone was trying to masquerade as &RHI; then they have certainly
          gone through a lot of trouble to do so.  In this case, the lack of a
          certified public key is not a major problem, given the fact that the
          CDROM came directly from the &RHI; offices.

          package still has size and checksum information that verified

          these verification measures built in automatically.

          of the line <computeroutput>(MISSING KEYS)</computeroutput> shows what
          the problem is.  Basically, RPM asked PGP to verify the package
          against a key that PGP didn't have, and PGP complained.

          Eventually it's going to happen &mdash; you go to verify a package,
          and it fails.  We'll look at an example of a package that fails
          verification a bit later.  Before we do that, let's
          <emphasis>make</emphasis> a package that won't verify, to demonstrate
          how sensitive RPM's verification is.
        </para>
        <para>
          First, we made a copy of a signed package,
          <filename>rpm-2.3-1.i386.rpm</filename>, to be specific.  We called
          the copy <filename>rpm-2.3-1.i386-bogus.rpm</filename>.  Next, using
          Emacs (in hexl-mode, for all you Emacs buffs), we changed the first
          letter of the name of the system that built the original package.  The
          file <filename>rpm-2.3-1.i386-bogus.rpm</filename> is now truly bogus:
          it has been changed from the original file.
        </para>
        <para>
          Although the change was a small one, it still showed up when the
          package file was queried.  Here's a listing from the original package:

        </para>
        <para>
          Notice that the build host name changed from
          <filename>porky.redhat.com</filename> to
          <filename>qorky.redhat.com</filename>.  Using the
          <command>cmp</command> utility to compare the two files, we find that
          the difference occurs at byte 1201, which changed from "p" (octal
          160), to "q" (octal 161):

          <screen width="60">
<prompt># </prompt><command>cmp -cl rpm-2.3-1.i386.rpm rpm-2.3-1.i386-bogus.rpm</command>
<computeroutput>
  1201 160 p    161 q
</computeroutput>
<prompt>#</prompt>
          </screen>
        </para>
        <para>
          People versed in octal numbers will note that only <emphasis>one
          bit</emphasis> has been changed in the entire file.  That's the
          smallest possible change you can make!  Let's see how our bogus friend
          fares:

          <screen width="60">
<prompt># </prompt><command>rpm -K rpm-2.3-1.i386-bogus.rpm</command>
<computeroutput>
rpm-2.3-1.i386-bogus.rpm: size PGP MD5 NOT OK
</computeroutput>
<prompt>#</prompt>
          </screen>
        </para>
        <para>
          Given that the command's output ends with <computeroutput>NOT
          OK</computeroutput> in big capital letters, it's obvious there's a
          problem.  Since the word <computeroutput>size</computeroutput> was
          printed in lowercase, the bogus package's size was OK, which makes
          sense &mdash; we only changed the value of one bit without adding or
          subtracting anything else.
        </para>
        <para>
          However, the PGP signature, printed in uppercase, didn't verify.
          Again, this makes sense, too. The package that was signed by &RHI; has
          been changed.  The fact that the package's MD5 checksum also failed to
          verify provides further evidence that the bogus package is just that:
          bogus.

        <para>
          Perhaps you want to be able to verify packages but, for one reason or
          another, you cannot use PGP.  Maybe you don't have a trustworthy
          source of the necessary public keys, or maybe it's illegal to possess
          encryption (like PGP) software in your country.  Is it still possible
          to verify packages?
        </para>
        <para>
          Certainly &mdash; in fact, we've already done it, in <xref
          linkend="s2-rpm-checksig-missing-public-key">.  You lose the ability
          to verify the package's origins, as well as some level of confidence
          in the package's integrity, but the size and MD5 checksums still give
          some measure of assurance as to the package's state.
        </para>
        <para>
          Of course, when PGP can't be used, the output from a verification
          always looks like something's wrong:

          <screen width="60">
<prompt># </prompt><command>rpm -K rpm-2.3-1.i386.rpm</command>

        </para>
        <para>
          The <command>--nopgp</command> option directs RPM to ignore PGP
          entirely.  If we use the <command>--nopgp</command> option on our
          example above, we find that things look a whole lot better:

          <screen width="60">
<prompt># </prompt><command>rpm -K --nopgp rpm-2.3-1.i386.rpm</command>

          you insights into how RPM verifies packages.  Here's an example:

          The lines starting with <computeroutput>D:</computeroutput> represent

          against looking at it.

        <para>
          Briefly, the output shows that RPM has detected a new-style signature
          block, containing size, MD5 checksum, and PGP signature information.
          The size of the signature, the size of the package file's header and
          archive sections, and the expected size of those sections are all
          displayed.

          The <command>--rcfile</command> option is used to specify a file
          containing default settings for RPM.  Normally, this option is not
          needed.  By default, RPM uses <filename>/etc/rpmrc</filename> and a
          file named <filename>.rpmrc</filename> located in your login
          directory.
        </para>
        <para>
          This option would be used if there was a need to switch between
          several sets of RPM defaults.  Software developers and package
          builders will normally be the only people using the
          <command>--rcfile</command> option.  For more information on
