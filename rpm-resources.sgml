    above the RPM <command>man</command> page, and this book.  Here are some
    pointers to them.

      Perhaps before asking, Where can I get RPM? it might be better to see if
      RPM is already installed on your system.  If you have &RHL; on your
      system, it's there already.  But be sure to check on other systems ---
      people are porting RPM to different systems every day, and it just might
      be there waiting for you.
    </para>
    <para>
      Here's a quick way to see if RPM is installed on your system:

    </para>

      If this command doesn't work, it might be that your path doesn't include
      the directory where RPM resides.  Check the usual "binary" directories
      before declaring RPM a no-show!

        If you can't find RPM on your system, you'll have to grab a copy by FTP.
        RPM can be found practically anywhere &RHL; is available.  While the
        most obvious site, <filename>ftp.redhat.com</filename>, is certainly an
        option, it might not be your best choice.  For one, it can be
        <emphasis>very</emphasis> busy.  For another, unless your link to the
        Internet is near Red Hat's sprawling development campus in Durham, North
        Carolina, there's probably an FTP site that is closer to you.
      </para>
      <para>
        Here is a list of sites that mirror &RHI;'s main FTP site.  Be aware
        that this list changes frequently, so don't be surprised if a particular
        site no longer mirrors Red Hat, or has moved it from the paths listed
        below:

        Once you find a nearby site with RPM, and have found the directory where
        it's kept, you'll notice a variety of files, all starting with
        "<filename>rpm</filename>".  What are they?  Which ones do you need?
        Here's a representative list, along with the ways in which each file
        would be used:

      <para>
        Although the version numbers may change, the types of files kept in this
        directory will not.  The files <filename>RPM-HOWTO</filename>,
        <filename>paper.ps.gz</filename>, and
        <filename>rpmbuild.ps.gz</filename> contain a variety of information
        concerning RPM.  As such they are valuable sources of supplemental
        information.  The remaining files contain RPM, packaged for various
        architectures, and in source form.  We'll look at them, grouped
        according to their contents.  Here's the first group of files:

<figure id="sc-rpm-resources-">
<title>*** Enter New Title Here ***</title>
<screen width="60">
-rw-r--r--  1 root  97  365319 Jul 18 06:05 rpm-2.2.2-1.axp.rpm
-rw-r--r--  1 root  97  282015 Jul 18 06:05 rpm-2.2.2-1.i386.rpm
-rw-r--r--  1 root  97  279855 Jul 18 06:05 rpm-2.2.2-1.sparc.rpm
</screen>
</figure>
The files above are the binary package files for RPM version 2.2.2, release
1, on the Digital Alpha, the Intel 386/486/Pentium, and the Sun SPARC.
Note that the version number will change in time, but the other parts of
the file naming convention won't.  As binary package files, they must be
installed using RPM.  So if you don't have RPM yet, they won't do you much
good.
<footnote>
<para>
If your goal is to install RPM on one of these systems, it
might be a good idea to copy the appropriate binary package.  That way,
once you have RPM running, you can reinstall it with the <command>--force</command>
option to ensure that RPM is properly installed and configured.
</para>
</footnote>
  Let's
look at the next file:

<figure id="sc-rpm-resources-">
<title>*** Enter New Title Here ***</title>
<screen width="60">
-rw-r--r--  1 root  97  359354 Jul 18 06:05 rpm-2.2.2-1.src.rpm
</screen>
</figure>
This is the source package file for RPM version 2.2.2, release 1.  Like the
binary packages, the source package requires RPM to install -- therefore,
it cannot be used to perform an initial install of RPM.  Let's see what
else there is here:

<figure id="sc-rpm-resources-">
<title>*** Enter New Title Here ***</title>
<screen width="60">
-rw-r--r--  1 root  97  122157 Jul 18 06:05 rpm-devel-2.2.2-1.axp.rpm
-rw-r--r--  1 root  97   51132 Jul 18 06:05 rpm-devel-2.2.2-1.i386.rpm
-rw-r--r--  1 root  97   54470 Jul 18 06:05 rpm-devel-2.2.2-1.sparc.rpm
</screen>
</figure>
The files above are binary package files that contain the
<filename>rpm-devel</filename> subpackage.  The <filename>rpm-devel</filename> package contains
header files and the RPM library, and is used for developing programs that
can perform RPM-related functions.  These files cannot be used to get RPM
running.  That leaves two files left:

<figure id="sc-rpm-resources-">
<title>*** Enter New Title Here ***</title>
<screen width="60">
-rw-rw-r--  1 root  97  278620 Jul 18 06:05 rpm-2.2.2-1.i386.cpio.gz
-rw-rw-r--  1 root  97  356943 Jul 18 06:05 rpm-2.2.2.tar.gz
</screen>
</figure>
The first file is a gzipped <command>cpio</command> archive of the files comprising
RPM.  After uncompressing the file, <command>cpio</command> can be used to extract
the files and place them on your system.  Note, however, that there is a
<command>cpio</command> archive for the i386 architecture only.  To extract the
files, issue the following command:

<figure id="sc-rpm-resources-">
<title>*** Enter New Title Here ***</title>
<screen width="60">
# <userinput>zcat file.cpio.gz | (cd / ; cpio --extract)</userinput>
#
</screen>
</figure>
(When actually issuing the command, <filename><emphasis>file.cpio.gz</filename></emphasis> should be
replaced with the actual name of the <command>cpio</command> archive.)

Note that the archive should be extracted using GNU <command>cpio</command> version
2.4.1 or greater.  It may also be necessary to issue the following command
prior to using RPM:

<figure id="sc-rpm-resources-">
<title>*** Enter New Title Here ***</title>
<screen width="60">
# <userinput>mkdir /var/lib/rpm</userinput>
#
</screen>
</figure>
The last file, <filename>rpm-2.2.2.tar.gz</filename>, contains the sources for RPM.
Using it, you can build RPM from scratch.  This is the most involved
option, but it is the only choice for people interested in porting RPM to a
new architecture.  See chapter <xref linkend="rpm-miscellania"> for an example of
RPM being built from the sources.

As much as we've tried to make this book a comprehensive reference for RPM,
there are going to be times when you'll need additional help.  The best way
to connect with other that use RPM is to try one of the following mailing
lists.

Red Hat <!-- *** RED HAT *** -->Software, Inc.\ maintains a mailing list specifically for RPM.  In
order to subscribe to the list, it's necessary to send a mail message to:

<figure id="sc-rpm-resources-">
<title>*** Enter New Title Here ***</title>
<screen width="60">
rpm-list-request@redhat.com
</screen>
</figure>
On the message's subject line, place the word <command>subscribe</command>.  After a
short delay, you should receive an automated response with general
information about the mailing list.

To send messages to the list, address them to:

<figure id="sc-rpm-resources-">
<title>*** Enter New Title Here ***</title>
<screen width="60">
rpm-list@redhat.com
</screen>
</figure>
As with other on-line forums, it's advisable to "lurk" for a while before
sending anything to the list.  That way, you'll be able to see what types
of questions are acceptable for the list.  Let the list's name be your
guide; if the message you want to send doesn't have anything to do with
RPM, you shouldn't send it to <filename>rpm-list</filename>!

In general, the flavor of <filename>rpm-list</filename> is a bit biased towards RPM's
development, building packages, and issues surrounding the porting of RPM
to other systems.  If your question is more along the lines of, How do I
use RPM to install new software? consider reviewing the first half of this
book and lurking on <filename>rpm-list</filename> a while first.

RPM is licensed under the GNU General Public License, or as it's more
commonly called, the GPL.  If you're not familiar with the GPL, it would be
worthwhile to spend a few minutes looking it over.  The purpose behind the
GPL is to ensure that GPL'ed software remains freely available.

"Freely available" doesn't necessarily mean "at no cost," although
GPL'ed software is often available by anonymous FTP.  The idea behind the
GPL is to make it impossible for anyone to take GPL'ed code, and make it
proprietary.  But enough preliminaries!  The best way to understand the GPL
is to read it:

\textbf{GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE}
Version 2, June 1991

Copyright &copy;\ 1989, 1991
Free Software Foundation, Inc.
675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

<sect2 id="s2-rpm-resources-">
<title>Preamble</title>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software -- to
make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to
any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free
Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public
License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs;
and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you
must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: 

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
copyright the software, and

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

</para>
</listitem>

</orderedlist>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If
the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any
problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'
reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

<title>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</title>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

<orderedlist>
\setcounter{enumi}{-1}

<listitem>
<para>
This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers
to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or
with modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of
having been made by running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on
what the Program does.

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices
that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the
Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under
the terms of this License.

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
not required to print an announcement.)

</para>
</listitem>

</orderedlist>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same
sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage
or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
this License.

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy
of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange; or,

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
Subsection b above.)

</para>
</listitem>

</orderedlist>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the
source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
the object code.

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance.

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program),
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms
and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works
based on it.

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms
and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy
both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of
the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range
of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

</para>
</listitem>

<para>
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

</para>

<para>
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<title>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</title>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free
software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<figure id="sc-rpm-resources-">
<title>*** Enter New Title Here ***</title>
<screen width="60">
&lt;one line to give the program name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

Copyright &copy;\ 19yy &lt;name of author&gt;


This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of
the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
</screen>
</figure>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when
it starts in an interactive mode:

<figure id="sc-rpm-resources-">
<title>*** Enter New Title Here ***</title>
<screen width="60">
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright &copy;\ 19yy name of author

Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
"show w".  This is free software, and you are welcome to
redistribute it under certain conditions; type "show c" for
details.
</screen>
</figure>
The hypothetical commands "show w" and "show c" should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands
you use may be called something other than "show w" and "show c"; they
could even be mouse-clicks or menu items -- whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

<blockquote>
<para>
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice
</para>
</blockquote>

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.
