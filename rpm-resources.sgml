    There are a number of resources available to help you with RPM, over and
    above the RPM <command>man</command> page, and this book.  Here are some
    pointers to them.

    <para>
      Perhaps before asking, Where can I get RPM? it might be better to see if
      RPM is already installed on your system.  If you have &RHL; on your
      system, it's there already.  But be sure to check on other systems &mdash;
      people are porting RPM to different systems every day, and it just might
      be there waiting for you.
    </para>

    <para>
      Here's a quick way to see if RPM is installed on your system:

      <screen width="60">
<prompt>% </prompt><userinput>rpm --version</userinput>
<computeroutput>
RPM version 2.3
</computeroutput>
<prompt>%</prompt>
      </screen>
    </para>

    <para>
      If this command doesn't work, it might be that your path doesn't include
      the directory where RPM resides.  Check the usual "binary" directories
      before declaring RPM a no-show!

      <para>
        If you can't find RPM on your system, you'll have to grab a copy by FTP.
        RPM can be found practically anywhere &RHL; is available.  While the
        most obvious site, <filename>ftp.redhat.com</filename>, is certainly an
        option, it might not be your best choice.  For one, it can be
        <emphasis>very</emphasis> busy.  For another, unless your link to the
        Internet is near Red Hat's sprawling development campus in Durham, North
        Carolina, there's probably an FTP site that is closer to you.
      </para>

      <para>
        Here is a list of sites that mirror &RHI;'s main FTP site.  Be aware
        that this list changes frequently, so don't be surprised if a particular
        site no longer mirrors Red Hat, or has moved it from the paths listed
        below:
        <footnote>
          <para>
            An up-to-date copy of the list of mirror sites is always available

        Once you find a nearby site with RPM, and have found the directory where
        it's kept, you'll notice a variety of files, all starting with
        "<filename>rpm</filename>".  What are they?  Which ones do you need?
        Here's a representative list, along with the ways in which each file
        would be used:

      <para>
        Although the version numbers may change, the types of files kept in this
        directory will not.  The files <filename>RPM-HOWTO</filename>,
        <filename>paper.ps.gz</filename>, and
        <filename>rpmbuild.ps.gz</filename> contain a variety of information
        concerning RPM.  As such they are valuable sources of supplemental
        information.  The remaining files contain RPM, packaged for various
        architectures, and in source form.  We'll look at them, grouped
        according to their contents.  Here's the first group of files:

        <screen width="60">
<computeroutput>
-rw-r--r--  1 root  97  365319 Jul 18 06:05 rpm-2.2.2-1.axp.rpm

        </screen>
      </para>

      <para>
        The files above are the binary package files for RPM version 2.2.2,
        release 1, on the Digital Alpha, the Intel 386/486/Pentium, and the Sun
        SPARC.  Note that the version number will change in time, but the other
        parts of the file naming convention won't.  As binary package files,
        they must be installed using RPM.  So if you don't have RPM yet, they
        won't do you much good.
        <footnote>
          <para>
            If your goal is to install RPM on one of these systems, it might be
            a good idea to copy the appropriate binary package.  That way, once
            you have RPM running, you can reinstall it with the
            <command>--force</command> option to ensure that RPM is properly
            installed and configured.
          </para>
        </footnote>
      </para>

      <para>
        Let's look at the next file:

        <screen width="60">
<computeroutput>
-rw-r--r--  1 root  97  359354 Jul 18 06:05 rpm-2.2.2-1.src.rpm
</computeroutput>
        </screen>
      </para>

      <para>
        This is the source package file for RPM version 2.2.2, release 1.  Like
        the binary packages, the source package requires RPM to install &mdash;
        therefore, it cannot be used to perform an initial install of RPM.
        Let's see what else there is here:

        <screen width="60">
<computeroutput>
-rw-r--r--  1 root  97  122157 Jul 18 06:05 rpm-devel-2.2.2-1.axp.rpm

      </para>

      <para>
        The files above are binary package files that contain the
        <filename>rpm-devel</filename> subpackage.  The
        <filename>rpm-devel</filename> package contains header files and the RPM
        library, and is used for developing programs that can perform
        RPM-related functions.  These files cannot be used to get RPM running.
        That leaves two files left:

        <screen width="60">
<computeroutput>
-rw-rw-r--  1 root  97  278620 Jul 18 06:05 rpm-2.2.2-1.i386.cpio.gz

</computeroutput>
        </screen>
      </para>

      <para>
        The first file is a gzipped <command>cpio</command> archive of the files
        comprising RPM.  After uncompressing the file, <command>cpio</command>
        can be used to extract the files and place them on your system.  Note,
        however, that there is a <command>cpio</command> archive for the i386
        architecture only.  To extract the files, issue the following command:

        <screen width="60">
<prompt># </prompt><userinput>zcat <replaceable>file.cpio.gz</replaceable> | (cd / ; cpio --extract)</userinput>
<prompt>#</prompt>
        </screen>
      </para>

      <para>
        (When actually issuing the command,
        <filename><replaceable>file.cpio.gz</replaceable></filename> should be
        replaced with the actual name of the <command>cpio</command> archive.)
      </para>

      <para>
        Note that the archive should be extracted using GNU
        <command>cpio</command> version 2.4.1 or greater.  It may also be
        necessary to issue the following command prior to using RPM:

        <screen width="60">
<prompt># </prompt><userinput>mkdir /var/lib/rpm</userinput>
<prompt>#</prompt>
        </screen>
      </para>

      <para>
        The last file, <filename>rpm-2.2.2.tar.gz</filename>, contains the
        sources for RPM.  Using it, you can build RPM from scratch.  This is the
        most involved option, but it is the only choice for people interested in
        porting RPM to a new architecture.  See <xref
        linkend="ch-rpm-miscellania"> for an example of RPM being built from the
        sources.

      As much as we've tried to make this book a comprehensive reference for

      </para>

      <para>

      <para>
        As with other on-line forums, it's advisable to "lurk" for a while
        before sending anything to the list.  That way, you'll be able to see
        what types of questions are acceptable for the list.  Let the list's
        name be your guide; if the message you want to send doesn't have
        anything to do with RPM, you shouldn't send it to
        <filename>rpm-list</filename>!
      </para>

      <para>
        In general, the flavor of <filename>rpm-list</filename> is a bit biased
        towards RPM's development, building packages, and issues surrounding the
        porting of RPM to other systems.  If your question is more along the

      be worthwhile to spend a few minutes looking it over.  The purpose behind
      the GPL is to ensure that GPL'ed software remains freely available.
    </para>

    <para>
      "Freely available" doesn't necessarily mean "at no cost," although GPL'ed
      software is often available by anonymous FTP.  The idea behind the GPL is
      to make it impossible for anyone to take GPL'ed code, and make it
      proprietary.  But enough preliminaries!  The best way to understand the
      GPL is to read it:

      <para>
        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
        share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
        intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software
        &mdash; to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
        General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's
        software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
        (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU
        Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your
        programs, too.
      </para>

      <para>
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
        Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
        freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
        service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
        want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
        free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
      </para>

      <para>
        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
        to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These
        restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
        distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
      </para>

      <para>
        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
        or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
        You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
        And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
      </para>

      <para>
        We protect your rights with two steps:

          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
        Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
        that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
        software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
        want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
        that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
        authors' reputations.
      </para>

      <para>
        Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
        We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
        individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
        proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
        must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

            This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
            notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
            under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
            below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the
            Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
            copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
            portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
            translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
            included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each

            Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
            covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
            running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
            Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
            the Program (independent of having been made by running the
            Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

                  If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                  when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                  interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display

                  a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
                  provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
                  program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
                  view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
                  itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
                  announcement, your work based on the Program is not required

            These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
            identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
            and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
            themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
            sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
            distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work
            based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the
            terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend
            to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of
            who wrote it.

            The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for

            associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
            control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as
            a special exception, the source code distributed need not include
            anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
            form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
            operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component

            through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this

      <title>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</title>

      <para>
        If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
        possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
        free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
        terms.
      </para>

      <para>
        To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
        attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
        the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
        "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

        <screen width="60">
&lt;one line to give the program name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

        If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
        when it starts in an interactive mode:

        <screen width="60">
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright &copy; 19yy name of author

        The hypothetical commands "show w" and "show c" should show the
        appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
        commands you use may be called something other than "show w" and "show
        c"; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items &mdash; whatever suits
        your program.

      <para>
        You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
        school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
        necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

        <blockquote>
          <para>
            Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
            program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
            James Hacker.

        This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
        into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
        may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
        with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
        General Public License instead of this License.
